This project presents the design and development of an innovative web-based platform that enables users to register for events, share memories, and view approved photos from past events. 
The system ensures privacy and security by allowing only registered and approved participants to access event photos. 
Event organizers manage registrations, approve or decline user participation, and review photos before they are made public. 
Built using React.js for the frontend and Django for the backend, the platform emphasizes user engagement, safety, and seamless event memory sharing. 
This project demonstrates practical implementation of real-time user interaction, data management, and role-based access control.
